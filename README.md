# macOS-Ultimate-Optimizer-Script
This script optimizes macOS systems for better performance, tailored for machines with high RAM, fast NVMe drives, and powerful GPUs. It fine-tunes network settings, memory management, disk I/O, GPU configurations, and general system settings, all through the command line.
Features
Network Optimizations

    Optimizes TCP parameters for faster connections.
    Flushes DNS cache and resets network settings.
    Improves performance for high-speed networks.

Memory Management

    Reduces swap usage on systems with high RAM.
    Adjusts free memory buffers and compression for efficiency.
    Enhances memory prefetch for large memory systems.

File System & Disk I/O

    Enables TRIM for SSDs/NVMe drives.
    Optimizes vnode limits and queue depth for faster disk access.
    Reduces memory pressure during file system operations.

GPU Tweaks

    Disables unnecessary animations and transparency effects.
    Speeds up window rendering and resizing.
    Enables HiDPI support for sharper resolutions.

Power Management
